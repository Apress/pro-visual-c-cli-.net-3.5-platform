Source code for Pro Visual C++/CLI and the .NET 3.5 Platform (978-1-4302-1053-5) by Stephen R. G. Fraser.

There are 3 pieces to this file:

1) All the Chapter source code directories. These you can copy anywhere you want. But I recommend the
   the "My Documents/Visual Studio 200x/Projects directory"  where "x" is your version of Visual Studio.

2) The wwwroot directory. You will copy to your wwwroot directory.

3) The Web Templates.zip file which contains templates to build Web Applications and Web Services. 
   The instructions to install these templates is found within the zip file.
